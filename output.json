    "content": "Volvo is gearing up for an electric blitz to convert all its mainstay models — three SUVs and two sedans — into electric vehicles and to introduce a luxury electric van aimed at boosting sales in Asia, two people with knowledge of the plans said. The Swedish carmaker, wholly owned by China’s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, is expected to launch at least six new battery electric vehicles throughout 2026, the two people told Reuters. Volvo has announced an objective to make its entire line-up fully electric by 2030. The company’s Australia unit has said it plans to sell only EVs in that market by 2026. The previously unreported product plans amount to the largest revamp of Volvo’s model line-up since Geely acquired the brand from Ford in 2010. Under Geely, Volvo initially started to share technologies such as car platforms with Geely. The makeover for Volvo, a Swedish brand that built a reputation for safety and utilitarian design, follows from a greater focus on customer trends in Asia and a push to win sales there, the people said. The two people with knowledge of Volvo’s planning asked not to be named because details have not been announced by the company. Geely declined to comment. Among the new battery electric cars being planned for the next four years is a Volvo-branded MPV or van that would be based on a vehicle Geely’s Zeekr brand sells in China. Called the Zeekr 009, the hulking, battery-electric van, which starts at about 500,000 yuan (R1.26m), offers three rows of seating. The vehicle competes against the likes of the Toyota Alphard, a business or family van, with aeroplane business class-like seats for passengers that has proven popular in Asian markets such as China and Japan as a limousine alternative. Volvo has moved development work on sedans and the coming people-mover model to its Shanghai research & development hub, they said. That centre, which has tripled its design staff to about 60 people, has recently moved to a new and larger building in Shanghai, one of the sources said. The first of Volvo’s new planned electric models, the EX90 sport-utility crossover, was unveiled late last year. It is expected to hit showrooms in early 2024. Other battery electric cars in the pipeline include electric versions of Volvo’s mainline products — the XC90, XC60 and XC40 crossover vehicles and the S60 and S90 sedans, the sources said. Those mainline cars will follow Volvo’s established, simple design cues, but the new MPV will target buyers in China and other markets with a more “emotional” design that builds from the Zeekr 009, which features a huge, LED-illuminated grille, one of the sources said. Volvo has carved out and sold its gasoline engine and hybrid power-train operations to Geely. The Chinese carmaker has moved to combine all of its petrol power-train assets, including those from Volvo, with factories being carved out of Renault to create a new company focused on hybrid and petrol engines. Renault and Geely are working to finalise a deal to bring Saudi Aramco in as an investor and partner in that venture, Reuters has reported.",

    "content": "Parts of Polokwane in Limpopo remain flooded, after heavy downpours on Wednesday afternoon. Spokesperson for the Polokwane local municipality Thipa Selala said the rain had uprooted trees, leaving some roads blocked. A tree-felling team had been activated to clear affected areas. “A preliminary report indicates the casualty ward at the Pietersburg Hospital was flooded and closed. More than 20 houses in the Nirvana area were flooded,” Selala said. He added a wall at the Tshwane University of Technology had collapsed, injuring one person. Law enforcement had to step in at one stage. “Some people took advantage of the rain and tried to loot from a business after its fence wall collapsed. Law enforcement was quick to respond and arrested four people,” he said. Selala said the municipality's telephone lines and electricity were affected but its teams had acted swiftly and they were back online. Residents who need the assistance of the municipality should call 015 290 2000 / 015 023 5000. TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times .

    "content": "The Union Budget 2023 presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has brought about significant changes to the import duties on various goods. While the import duty on diamond seeds has been reduced, the customs duty on gold, silver, and platinum has been hiked to 10 per cent. This step is aimed at promoting domestic production and cementing India's position as a leader in the cutting and polishing of natural diamonds. The increased customs duty on gold and platinum bars and articles made from them will lead to a rise in the prices of these precious metals. Similarly, the import duties on silver bars, strings, and other items have also been raised to match those of gold and platinum, thereby encouraging domestic production. India is currently the third largest physical silver investment market in the world, and due to a rise in jewelry consumption, the country's silver imports are expected to reach a record high of 8,000 tonnes in 2022. The elimination of import duties on diamond seeds will aid India in becoming a dominant player in the cutting and polishing of natural diamonds, which accounts for nearly three-fourths of the global market value. In addition, government has reduced the import duty on seeds used to produce laboratory-grown diamonds. This reduction will make the diamond production process more cost-effective, thus fostering the growth of the nation's diamond industry. Lab-made diamonds are created in a controlled laboratory setting using advanced technology and are chemically, physically, and optically identical to naturally occurring diamonds and are a lot more cheaper than the natural diamonds.

    "content": "India and the United States are keen for an early conclusion of the 30 MQ-9B predator armed drones deal at a cost of over USD 3 billion, which will help New Delhi strengthen its overall surveillance apparatus along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and the Indian Ocean. In the works for more than five years, the 'ball is now in India's court', officials familiar with the development said Wednesday, without explaining further. The MQ-9B predator armed drones -- 10 each for three services -- is seen to be a key part of India's national security and defense needs. The officials did not elaborate further but ruled out that there was any bureaucratic hurdle or regulatory issues involved. \"I have to take that back and check on that,\" Assistant Secretary of State for Political Military Affairs Jessica Lewis told reporters here when asked for the delay in the deal, which was announced in the summer of 2017. Read More Related stories Kerala journalist Siddique Kappan walks out of Uttar Pradesh jail on bail India will cut import tariff on pecans by 70%; says Senator Jon Ossoff It has been pending for quite some time now, for reasons not known in the public. However, the issues are believed to have been discussed during the meetings that the visiting National Security Advisor Ajit K Doval has had with top American leadership, including his counterpart Jake Sullivan. During the meetings, it is believed that both sides expressed their eagerness to see that the drone deal is fast tracked. India is eager that an early decision would help it get an early delivery of MQ-98 predator armed drones that would strengthen its national security and surveillance not only in the Indian Ocean, but also along the LAC. The Biden administration is keen on inking this deal as soon as possible, which will create jobs and would be politically beneficial ahead of the next year's presidential elections, according to people familiar with the development. \"MQ-9B would enable its Indian military users to fly farther than anything else in this category, spend more time in the air and handle a greater diversity of missions than any other similar aircraft. The SkyGuardian and SeaGuardian can deliver full-motion video in virtually any conditions, day or night, as well as other kinds of detailed sensing with their onboard systems,\" Vivek Lall, chief executive, General Atomics Global Corporation, told PTI. \"The aircraft also can carry a wide variety of specialist payloads if they must adapt to a specific mission. A SkyGuardian becomes a SeaGuardian, for example, when it carries a 360-degree maritime search radar that gives users a quality of maritime domain awareness they can't achieve any other way,\" he said. Artificial intelligence, machine learning and other sophisticated technologies help unlock the rich feed of insight from these aircraft, analyse it and distribute it to those who need it to take quick decisions, Lall said. \"Other payloads include communications relays so the aircraft can serve as a node connecting forces over land or sea or other intelligence, surveillance or military systems. These aircraft can conduct search and rescue, help fight wildfires, support customs authorities, augment naval forces and take many other tasks,\" he said. \"In short, MQ-9B is the premier multi-role, long endurance remotely piloted aircraft in the world today. It is in high demand. Japan, Belgium, Great Britain, and several other nations are flying or are on track to begin flying them,\" Lall said. Early in the day, Assistant Secretary of State for Political Military Affairs Lewis told reporters that the India-US defense relationship has gained pace. \"When we look at the relationship with India and our security cooperation with India and the defense relationship with India over the past 10 years or even a little bit longer, we've really seen that grow and evolve and change in very positive ways,\" Lewis said in response to a question. \"I think all the discussions (during this week's iCET dialogue) are in that context,\" she said, a day after the two countries embarked upon the ambitious initiative in critical and emerging technologies. \"Everything from Indian procurement and or consideration of US systems and India's competition, when they're having competitions for specific systems, to just the across-the-board relationship between our defense department, the Ministry of Defense. So we see this as a place where we want to continue to work closely,\" she said. \"Without getting into any of the details of the conversation, I think it's a very rich conversation right now. And one that we're deeply committed to not only continuing but to have growth,\" Lewis said. Responding to a question, the State Department official said the US is ready to help India diversify its defence needs. \"When it comes to India, I think there are a whole host of options. Obviously, we need to work those out with the Indian government, see what the needs are. But I think there are a whole host of options in terms of us being able to find additional systems, ways to cooperate. Obviously respecting India's own sort of rules of the game in terms of how that works. There's a lot more that we can do together and hope we can continue to work on that,\" Lewis said.",

    "content": "Quantum computers have started rolling off the production line in China, according to local media reports. Global Times offers one of many such accounts and China Television has also covered the news. None of the reports offer concrete detail. Indeed, many open with a reference to the presence of a quantum computer in the recently released Chinese action blockbuster \"Wandering Earth 2\" then enthuse about that science fiction vision having become reality. All report that the computer was produced in the city of Hefei, which is in Anhui province where the local government is known to have funded a quantum computer lab. Some quote an outfit called Origin Quantum as having been informed of the debut by Anhui quantum lab. Others suggest the computers were quietly slipped into production at Chinese organizations in 2021 and are now available for other buyers. All offer a joyous patriotic note that the machines' debut puts China in an elite and exclusive club of nations capable of delivering working quantum computers. They enthuse that the Middle Kingdom is standing at the threshold of super-fast problem solving for the benefit of humanity and such like. While the reports may be fuzzy, China certainly has quantum ambitions: it has demonstrated long-range quantum key distribution using satellites , developed quantum encryption tech and banned its export , and has researchers working on quantum computers. Those efforts are sufficiently large, and advanced, that the Biden administration last year announced policies aimed at preserving US leadership in the field. That leadership is currently epitomized by IBM's products, which last week became the subject of a gushing Time Magazine cover story . In the real world, meanwhile, analysts suggest one of China's main interests in quantum computers is breaking classical encryption . China has lots of big challenges that quantum computing could help to address. It also has enormous military ambitions, and a lengthy track record of using technology to surveil and oppress its citizens. You won't read about the latter in Chinese media or social media. But you can read about Chinese netizens' reaction to The New York Times negative review of \"Wandering Earth 2\". ®",

    "content": "According to Statista, in 2022, revenues from the global artificial intelligence market were expected to reach 433 billion U.S. dollars. The global AI market is forecast to see rapid growth in the coming years, reaching more than half a trillion U.S. dollars by 2023. In 2019, IBM held the largest market share with 8.8 percent, while Microsoft claimed the second largest market share with 5.6 percent. As artificial intelligence and robotics evolve and become integrated into more aspects of our lives, however, we must be aware of the potential risks. Some of these risks include the loss of control over AI systems, the potential for harm to humans or the environment, unequal distribution of benefits, and ethical and moral dilemmas. In the context of business and the marketing industry, the merging of AI and robotics can also have significant implications. For example, there may be changes in consumer behavior and the need for new marketing strategies. Additionally, the ethical considerations surrounding AI and robotics use in marketing, such as data privacy and fairness in targeting, may be relevant. 4 Risks of AI: Job Displacement: One of the biggest concerns associated with AI is its potential to displace large numbers of workers. As AI systems become more capable of performing tasks traditionally performed by humans, there is a risk that many jobs will become automated. While this may lead to increased efficiency and productivity, it could also lead to widespread unemployment, as workers are replaced by machines. Bias and Discrimination: Another risk associated with AI is the potential for bias and discrimination. AI systems rely on large amounts of data to make decisions and predictions, and if this data is biased, the AI system may make decisions that unfairly impact certain groups of people. For example, if an AI system used to make hiring decisions is trained on data that contains gender or racial biases, it may make decisions that unfairly disadvantage certain groups of people. Lack of Accountability: AI systems are often designed to operate autonomously, without direct human oversight. This lack of accountability can make it difficult to determine who is responsible when things go wrong, such as when an AI system causes harm or violates privacy. This lack of accountability also makes it difficult to hold AI systems accountable for their decisions and actions. Potential for Misuse: Another risk associated with AI is the potential for misuse. AI systems can be used for malicious purposes, such as cyberattacks, or for purposes that violate privacy and civil liberties. For example, AI systems can be used to monitor and track individuals, or to manipulate public opinion through fake news and propaganda. 3 Negative Effects of AI: Decreased Privacy and Security: One of the biggest negative effects of AI is the potential for decreased privacy and security. As AI systems collect and process large amounts of data about individuals, there is a risk that this data could be used for malicious purposes, such as identity theft or cyberattacks. Additionally, AI systems can be vulnerable to hacking and other forms of cybercrime, which can put personal and sensitive information at risk. Decreased Human Creativity and Critical Thinking: Another negative effect of AI is the potential for decreased human creativity and critical thinking. As AI systems become more capable of performing tasks traditionally performed by humans, there is a risk that people will become less engaged in creative and critical thinking activities. This could lead to a decline in innovation and problem-solving ability, as well as a decline in overall well-being and satisfaction. The Widening Gap between the Rich and the Poor: A third negative effect of AI is the potential for the widening gap between the rich and the poor. As AI systems automate many jobs traditionally performed by humans, there is a risk that the benefits of this automation will accrue primarily to the wealthy, while the majority of people are left behind. This could lead to increased income inequality and decreased social mobility, which could have negative consequences for society as a whole. The ethical and social implications of AI are complex and far-reaching. AI systems are capable of making decisions and predictions that can have significant impacts on individuals, communities, and society as a whole. As such, it’s important to consider the ethical and social implications of AI and to develop guidelines and regulations that ensure that this technology is used for the benefit of society as a whole.",
